            <h3>Releasing April 28</h3>
            <p>
                Whew, this has been one hell of a song to get out. I was initially going to scrap it, but eventually decided to release it (with minor backlash from the quality department). And then I had to cancel it due to said quality department deciding it wasn't representative of my creative values. After some small edits, I was able to pass it through and get it released, which will be happening on April 28. This song really came from the heart, and it took a lot of effort to produce.
